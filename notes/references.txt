"We demonstrate a method for constructing spacetime diagrams for special relativity on graph paper that has been 
rotated by 45°. The diagonal grid lines represent light-flash worldlines in Minkowski spacetime, and the boxes in the 
grid (called “clock diamonds”) represent units of measurement corresponding to the ticks of an inertial observer's light 
clock. We show that many quantitative results can be read off a spacetime diagram simply by counting boxes, with very 
little algebra. In particular, we show that the squared interval between two events is equal to the signed area of the 
parallelogram on the grid (called the “causal diamond”) with opposite vertices corresponding to those events. We use 
the Doppler effect—without explicit use of the Doppler formula—to motivate the method."

Distortion of the stellar sky by a Schwarzschild black hole
Thomas Müllera) and Daniel Weiskopf (Visualisierungsinstitut der Universität Stuttgart)

"The optical appearance of the stellar sky for an observer in the vicinity of a black 
hole is dominated by bending of light, the frequency shift, and the magnification 
caused by gravitational lensing and aberration. Due to the finite aperture of an 
observer’s eye or a telescope, Fraunhofer diffraction has to be taken into account. 
We have used high performance graphics hardware and developed a program that enables 
the user to interactively explore the stellar sky in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild 
black hole. To do so, we determine what an observer, who can either move 
quasistatically around the black hole or follow a timelike radial geodesic, would actually see."

looking at a static environment and having a look-around near a compact object. 
I illustrate and explain the main aspects of the visual observations, outline

"We investigate the effects of the aberration of light for a uniformly accelerating observer. The
observer is initially at rest with respect to a luminous spherical object and then starts to move away
with constant acceleration. Our main results are the following: 
(i) The observer sees an initial increase of the apparent size of the object, 
(ii) the apparent size of the object approaches a nonzero
value as the proper time of the observer goes to infinity, and 
(iii) there exists a critical value of the
acceleration such that the apparent size of the object is monotonically increasing when the
acceleration is supercritical. 
Although the first effect is purely nonrelativistic, the others are the
result of the relativistic aberration of light and are intimately connected with the Lorentzian
geometry of Minkowksi spacetime. The examples we present illustrate that the three effects are
more or less negligible in everyday life, but significant in the context of space flight."

and use it to visualize and calculate effects resulting from the successive application of non-collinear Lorentz boosts. 
In particular, we show how rapidity space provides a geometric approach to Wigner rotation and Thomas precession in the

"An object at relativistic speed is seen as both rotated and distorted when it 
is large or close by so that it subtends a large solid angle. This is a consequence
of the aberration effect and is obtained by purely geometric considerations. 
In this paper it is pointed out and illustrated that a photorealistic image 
of such an object would actually be dominated by the Doppler and searchlight 
effects, which would be so prominent as to render the geometric apparent 
shape effectively invisible."

technique, we derive expressions for the relativistic transformation of radiance. 
We show how to incorporate the Doppler and searchlight effects in the two common 
techniques of special relativistic visualization, namely ray tracing and polygon 
rendering. Most authors consider geometrical appearance only and neglect 
relativistic effects on the lighting model. Chang et al. [1996] present an

"Because of its apparent complexity, the discussion of Wigner rotation is usually
reduced to the study of Thomas precession, which is too specific a case to allow a deep understanding
of boost composition. However, by using simple arguments and linear algebra, the result for the
Wigner rotation is obtained straightforwardly, leading to a formula written in a manageable form.
The result is exemplified in the context of the aberration of light."

Image Shading Taking into Account Relativistic Effects

"This article is concerned with creating more realistic images of 3D scenes which are moving
relative to the viewer at such high speeds that the propagation delay of light signals and other
relativistic effects can not be neglected. Creating images of 3D scenes in relativistic motio
nmight have important applications to science-fiction films, computer games, and virtual
environments. We shall discuss the following problems: (1) how to determine the visual
appearance of a rapidly moving object, (2) how to determine the apparent radiance of a scene
point on a moving object, (3) how to determine the incident irradiance at a scene point coming
from a moving light source, (4) how to determine the color of a rapidly moving object, and 
(5)how to generate shadows when there are relative motions between the viewer, the scenes, and
the light sources. Detailed examples are also given to show the result of shading with the
relativistic effects taken into account."

[g] The interstellar traveler

American Journal of Physics 63, 221 (1995)
"We investigate the physics of an interstellar journey on board a spaceship with a constant 
acceleration, in the framework of special relativity. It is in principle possible to cross 
the Galaxy within a human lifetime. The aspect of the sky seen from the spaceship is 
severely distorted by relativistic aberration; most of the visible sky shrinks to a small 
region of strongly enhanced luminance in the direction of motion, leaving the rest of the 
celestial sphere almost entirely dark. The invisible universe becomes perceptible by the 
traveler, as the infrared and radio radiations are Doppler-shifted to visible frequencies 
in the direction of motion. Navigational problems posed by these relativistic effects are examined."

[y] A superluminal source in the Galaxy
I. F. Mirabel (Service d'Astrophysique, Centre d'Etudes de Saclay, France), L. F. Rodriguez (NRAO)
Letters to Nature val 371, 1 September 1994
"APPARENT velocities greater than the speed of light (superluminal motion) have been inferred for radio-emitting 
components in a number of distant quasars and active galactic nuclei1. These components move away from the central 
sources (generally thought to be super-massive black holes) at rates that seem to imply velocities greater than c. The 
accepted explanation is that clouds of plasma are ejected in opposite directions from the central source at speeds close 
to (but less than) that of light, and that relativistic effects lead to the apparent superluminal motion2. But the extreme 
distance of the objects observed so far introduces many uncertainties into this interpretation3. Here we present observations 
of the first apparent superluminal motion ever detected in a source within our own Galaxy. The optical, infrared and X-ray 
properties4,5 of the counterpart suggest that the source is either a neutron star or a black hole that is ejecting matter 
in a process similar to, but on a smaller scale than that seen in quasars. Because of its relative proximity, this superluminal 
microquasar may offer the best opportunity to gain a general understanding of relativistic ejections seen elsewhere in the Universe."

that illustrate concepts of simultaneity and use of the Lorentz transformation. Transformation of light intensity

"An individual observer located at one position in space collecting information from the 
retarded light cone is confronted with aberration and Doppler shift, but also with a shift 
in intensity and pressure of the observed radiation. The latter are derived using the photon 
hypothesis and are applied to the cosmic microwave background. The interaction of matter with 
the cosmic background radiation tends to bring the matter to rest in a preferred frame in 
which the radiation is isotropic."

"Several articles have considered the apparent shape of a relativistic sphere. One interesting finding showed that, under 
certain conditions, the surface of the sphere may appear concave. This article concentrates on the case where the observer 
is at the origin and the sphere moves in the positive x direction with its center on the x axis. The sphere actually hits 
the observer, and one of the findings presented here is that for any speed v, 0<v≤c, part of the surface appears concave for 
some part of the motion along the x axis."

several fairly simple considerations, appropriate for brief classroom presentation."

Anticausal behavior in the imaging of a moving object; the implications for high-speed photography
Kenneth L. Sala (NRC, Ottawa)
Phys. Rev. A 19 2377-2391 (1979)
"An analysis of the temporal behavior of the image of a moving object in a simple imaging system is presented which explicitly 
takes into account the finite transit time of the light propagating from the object to the image plane. This analysis, which 
places no restrictions on the magnification of the imaging system or on the spatial shape or extent of the object, uncovers a 
number of novel and highly unorthodox phenomena hitherto unforeseen. Of particular significance, in the case where the object
velocity vo and the magnification M satisfy (M+1)voc>1, is the finding that a single object gives rise to two simultaneous 
images which move antiparallel to one another away from a common point in the image plane. One of these images displays a
normal, forward time dependence, while the other image exhibits a time-reversal character resulting in the anticausality 
in the observed temporal behavior of the object and of time-dependent or causal events associated with it. The theory is 
developed to include the imaging of arbitrary, three-dimensional objects. The important case where the object is stationary 
but has a time-dependent intensity distribution is also examined and it is shown, in this case as well, that anticausal 
behavior can be observed in the image plane under quite general conditions. The ramifications of this work for high-speed 
photography in general are discussed, and numerous illustrations are given of the image behavior in time for moving 
objects of simple geometrical shapes."

[y] In search of the "starbow": The appearance of the starfield from a relativistic spaceship
John M. McKinley, Paul Doherty (Oakland University)
Am. J. Phys. vol 47 No. 4 April 1979 p309
"One prediction for the appearance of the starfield from a moving reference frame has been circulated widely despite 
physically objectionable features. We reexamine the physical basis for this effect. To the well-known aberation [sic] and 
Doppler effects we add the transformation of intensity of light upon a change of reference frame. We integrate the 
transformed spectrum of a star, represented as a blackbody, over the response function of the human eye. We present a 
one-parameter function to represent the dependence of the apparent visual magnitude of different stars upon Doppler factor. 
We conclude with a sequence of computer-generated figures to show the appearance of Earth’s starfield at various velocities.
A 'starbow' does not appear."

"FERGUSON (ref. 1 and unpublished work) and Cocke, Ferguson, and Muncaster (in preparation) have 
interpreted the optical polarization of the Crab Nebula pulsar by means of a rotating relativistic 
vector model. It was assumed in this work that the percentage linear polarization of a collimated 
beam of light is the same when measured by different observers in relative motion with respect to 
each other. This assumption led us to investigate the general Lorentz transformation characteristics 
of partially elliptically polarized radiation, and in this paper we study the transformation 
properties of the Stokes parameters. This problem has astrophysical interest, not only for the 
Crab Nebula pulsar, but also for other cosmic sources emitting elliptically polarized radiation, 
such as the synchrotron sources studied by Pacholczyk and Swihart2."

"The question of the apparent visual shape of an object moving at relativistic speeds, as perceived by a single observer, 
is analysed afresh. It is shown by qualitative arguments that the apparent shape is related to the shape at rest through a 
combination of nonuniform shear and extension/contraction parallel to the direction of motion, which does not reduce to a 
rotation even in the case of distant objects subtending a small angle at the observer. The two-dimensional projection 
(as in a photograph) of this distorted shape may coincide with that of the object (suitably rotated) at rest; but we 
emphasize that it would be grossly misleading to conclude from this, as is generally done in the literature, that distant 
relativistically moving objects appear as if simply rotated. The 'train paradox' is discussed in illustration of this point. 
Analytical formulae relating the apparent visual shape to the shape at rest are given. Also the striking fact that the 
apparent speed of the object as seen by visual observation may well exceed the speed of light is brought out. Finally it is 
pointed out that the phenomenon is closely analogous to the relativistic Doppler effect."
[They correct Terrell, saying it's not a pure rotation, but nonuniform shear + extension/contraction, even in the 
case of small solid angle.]

"We give a diagrammatic representation of the diagonal form of the special Lorentz transformation. The null 
coordinates x±ct are plotted along a single set of orthogonal axes. Special Lorentz transformations are then represented 
only by a change of scale along those orthogonal axes. This diagram, which we call a null coordinate diagram, and the

Special Relativity and Diagonal Transformations
Leonard Parker and Glenn M. Schmieg (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee)
American Journal of Physics 38, 218 (1970); https://doi.org/10.1119/1.1976289
"We discuss the form of the special Lorentz transformation, and the corresponding transformation of the electromagnetic 
field, in which the transformation matrix is diagonal. We derive the diagonal form of the special Lorentz transformation 
directly, in a simple way, and show that it is sometimes more convenient to apply than the algebraically equivalent 
conventional form of the transformation. The convenience is especially evident in deriving the linear Doppler effect, 
and the relativistic addition of more than two parallel velocities. By writing Maxwell's equations in terms of linear 
combinations of coordinates which have simple transformation properties, we arrive at the transformation equations of 
the Maxwell fields in a diagonal form, as well as at the plane wave solutions, in a natural manner. The derivations 
and applications described above should be of use in a course on relativity because of their simplicity and directness."

[y] Geometrical Appearances at Relativistic Speeds
G. D. Scott, H. J. van Driel, University of Toronto
Am. J. Phys. vol 38 No. 8 August 1970
https://doi.org/10.1119/1.1976550
"Geometrical appearances at relativistic speeds (β=0.5,0.9,and 0.995) are illustrated for the following examples: 
(i) the celestial sphere with a number of constellations, (ii) the surface features of a sphere passing close to an observer, 
and (iii) a train of rectangular boxes. The figures make clear the nature of the distortions which occur in appearances, 
indicate the limited significance of the so-called 'apparent rotation', and show the conditions under which the Lorentz
 contraction can be seen or photographed. Though a sphere remains essentially circular in outline, the apparent cross 
 section may be grossly distorted and under some conditions the outside surface of the sphere appears concave."

The apparent shape of rapidly moving objects in special relativity
N. C. McGill
Contemp. Phys. 9, 33 p33-48
"A review is presented of previous papers on the apparent shape of bodies travelling with speeds comparable to that of light. 
It is shown that the visibility or otherwise of the Lorentz contraction depends on the method of observation adopted and on 
the shape of the body in question. Visual, photographic and radar-type methods are discussed, including the hitherto neglected 
application of stereoscopic perception. The theory is developed for a new possible technique of observation, that in which an 
object illuminates itself momentarily in its rest frame, the image being recorded as a time exposure by the observer."

[y] Appearance of relativistically expanding radio sources
M. J. Rees, University of Cambridge
Nature vol 211 July 30 1966
"In this article it is suggested that the central parts of some radio sources may expand with relativistic velocities.
Relativistic effects could then have a decisive influence on the observable properties of thes sources. In particular, 
the flux from a radio source expanding with relativistic velocity can change sufficiently rapidly to account for the
variations observed in some sources, even if they are at cosmological distances. A related relativistic effect would 
imply that the ages of some types of radio sources may be significantly less than the usual estimates."

Graphical Aids in the Teaching of Special Relativity
American Journal of Physics 34, 1128 (1966); https://doi.org/10.1119/1.1972527
Robert H. Kohler (Rutgers—The State University, Newark, New Jersey)
"The kinematics of special relativity is depicted through space-time diagrams, whereby the Lorentz transformation as well 
as the Galilean can be presented in graphical form rather than analytic. The space-time diagrams are then used to formulate 
and explain several of the paradoxes of special relativity. The method is a variation of the Minkowski diagram. The reference 
axes are kept fixed, and the space-time point undergoes an apparent displacement in the plot as the observation frame is 
changed. The graphical analysis is semiquantitative for some problems and is quantitative for others."

The geometrical appearance of large objects moving at relativistic speeds
G.D. Scott, M. R. Viner  (University of Toronto)
Am. J. Phys. 33, 534-536 (1965)
https://doi.org/10.1119/1.1971890
Bibcode: 1965AmJPh..33..534S 
"The calculated geometrical appearance of objects moving at relativistic speeds and subtending large angles at 
the observer is illustrated by diagrams of a plane grid and perspective views of a group of boxes. In addition to 
the distortion of scales in the direction of motion, planes perpendicular to the motion appear as hyperboloids. 
Contrary to an impression which might be taken from some papers on the subject, the Lorentz contraction is visible 
under suitable conditions, in particular for observations approximately at right angles to the motion."
also:
"... the explanation of the appearance in terms of a rotation is quite inadequate."

"An experiment has been performed to demonstrate the relativistic time dilation as a large effect, using only comparatively 
simple equipment. μ-mesons incident on top of Mt. Washington, New Hampshire, were selected to have speeds in the range between 
0.9950c and 0.9954c. The number of these which survived to reach sea level was measured in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The 
number expected without time dilation was calculated from the distribution of decay times of these μ-mesons (i.e., the mean 
life as measured in both this experiment and others) and from the known distance of descent. The observed time dilation factor 
is 8.8±0.8 to be compared with the effective time dilation factor calculated for mesons of these speeds in our detection

Length Contraction Paradox
W. Rindler (Cornell)
American Journal of Physics 29, 365 (1961); https://doi.org/10.1119/1.1937789
"A certain man walks very fast—so fast that the relativistic length contraction makes him very thin. In the street he has 
to pass over a grid. A man standing at the grid fully expects the fast thin man to fall into the grid. Yet to the fast man 
the grid is much narrower even than to the stationary man, and he certainly does not expect to fall in. Which is correct?
The answer hinges on the relativity of rigidity."

"It has been recently recognized that there is a difference between the measured Lorentz contracted shape of an object 
moving at relativistic speed and the shape as seen by a single observer. The case of an object which subtends a small 
solid angle at the observer has been discussed by several authors. This paper discusses objects so large or so near that 
the subtended solid angle cannot be considered small, and gives simple proofs that spheres always present a circular 
outline and that straight lines may appear curved. These results are applied to revise Gamow's well-known picture of the 
bicyclist seen by Mr. Tompkins."

The visual appearance of rapidly moving objects
V. F. Weisskopf (M.I.T.)
Phys. Today 13 (9), 24–27 (1960)
https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3057105
"I would like to draw the attention of physicists to a recent paper by James Terrell in which he does away with an old 
prejudice held by practically all of us. We all believed that, according to special relativity, an object in motion appears 
to be contracted in the direction of motion by a factor [1−(υ/c)]1/2 [sic!]. A passenger in a fast space ship, looking out of the
window, so it seemed to us, would see spherical objects contracted to ellipsoids. This is definitely not so according to 
Terrell's considerations, which for the special case of a sphere were also carried out by R. Penrose. The reason is quite 
simple. When we see or photograph an object, we record light quanta emitted by the object when they arrive simultaneously 
at the retina or at the photographic film. This implies that these light quanta have not been emitted simultaneously by all 
points of the object. The points further away from the observer have emitted their part of the picture earlier than the 
closer points. Hence, if the object is in motion, the eye or the photograph gets a “distorted” picture of the object, since 
the object has been at different locations when different parts of it have emitted the light seen in the picture."

Observation of Length by a Single Observer
R. Weinstein (Northeastern University, Boston)
Am. J. Phys. 28, 607–610 (1960)
"One problem arising in teaching special relativity is the confusion in many texts of the thought experiments, used in 
developing the theory, with other simple laboratory operations. As an example we consider here the observation of length. 
The existence of the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction has led educators to conclude that one sees a contraction of a rapidly 
moving body. However, the act of seeing involves a single observer, while the observation of the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction 
requires at least two observers. It is shown here that the length seen by a single observer is not the usual contraction, 
and indeed, under certain circumstances, one sees a body considerably lengthened rather than contracted."

Hyperbolic Motion in Curved Space Time
W. Rindler (Cornell University)
Physical Review, vol. 119, Issue 6, pp. 2082-2089
10.1103/PhysRev.119.2082 
"The differential equations of motion for a test particle moving with uniform acceleration in a curved space time are proposed. 
They are obtained by generalizing the differential-geometric characteristics of a rectangular hyperbola in Minkowski space time. 
The problem is proposed, though not solved, of deriving these equations of motion from the field equations of general relativity. 
However, it is suggested that they also hold independently of general relativity in cosmological space times based on the 
Robertson-Walker metric. The equations are solved in detail for the particular case of de Sitter space time, which is relevant 
to the steady-state theory. It is found, inter alia, that in this space time a particle moving radially with uniform acceleration 
ultimately moves with constant relative velocity through the substratum; that there is a critical first fundamental particle
(galaxy) on its line of motion which it will never overtake; that, in turn, a light signal emitted at or after a certain 
critical time will not catch up with the accelerating particle; and that, if a particle with a given available acceleration α 
passes beyond a certain proper distance (the α horizon) it can no longer return to its place of origin. Possible applications 
to intergalactic rocketry are examined."

[y] Invisibility of the Lorentz Contraction
James Terrell (University of California, Los Alamos)
Physical Review vol 116, No. 4, November 15 1959
"It is shown that, if the apparent directions of objects are plotted as points on a sphere surrounding the observer, the 
Lorentz transformation corresponds to a conformal transformation on the surface of this sphere. Thus, for sufficiently small 
subtended solid angle, an object will appear—optically—the same shape to all observers. A sphere will photograph with precisely 
the same circular outline whether stationary or in motion with respect to the camera. An object of less symmetry than a sphere, 
such as a meter stick, will appear, when in rapid motion with respect to an observer, to have undergone rotation, not contraction. 
The extent of this rotation is given by the aberration angle (θ−θ′), in which θ is the angle at which the object is seen by 
the observer and θ′ is the angle at which the object would be seen by another observer at the same point stationary with 
respect to the object. Observers photographing the meter stick simultaneously from the same position will obtain precisely 
the same picture, except for a change in scale given by the Doppler shift ratio, irrespective of their velocity relative to 
the meter stick. Even if methods of measuring distance, such as stereoscopic photography, are used, the Lorentz contraction 
will not be visible, although correction for the finite velocity of light will reveal it to be present."

New Geometric Representation of the Lorentz Transformation
Henri Amar (Lafayette College, Pennsylvania)
American Journal of Physics 23, 487 (1955); https://doi.org/10.1119/1.1934074
"Most geometric representations of the Lorentz transformation use either imaginary angles or imaginary space-time coordinates. 
A new and simple representation is proposed using only real coordinates and real angles, and allowing a graphical illustration 
of the major features of the Lorentz transformation."
