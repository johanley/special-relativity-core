Points to be made
----------------------

1.
In a camera, relativistic spheres remain spherical in OUTLINE only.

2. 
Acceleration affects aberration?
Or maybe I'm misreading the paper?

2.5 
Hyper accelerated reflecting telescopes can't see anything?
Null geodesics are all bent away from straight lines.
Change the speed between the time the photon enters the tube and when the photon reaches the bottom of the tube.
The change in the aberration angle is the same as the angular size of the mirror, as seen from the top end of the tube.

3. 
There is disagreement with Terrell's assertions.
Scott and van Driel:

  'The relation of the distortion to Terrel's (sic) "apparent rotation" can be appreciated but 
  certainly an interpretation merely in terms of rotation is not possible. The Lorentz contraction 
  can indeed be photographed but shows properly only in a direction perpendicular to the motion.'
  
  (van Driel and Scott have diagrams that are not for Terrell's case of small solid angle).
  
  So do Mathews and Lakshmanan.
  "... the apparent shape is related to the shape at rest through a combination of nonuniform shear and 
  extension/contraction parallel to the direction of motion, which does not reduce to a rotation even 
  in the case of distant objects subtending a small angle at the observer... Clearly this picture of apparent rotation 
  cannot be right. "
  
  So do Scott and Viner 1965.
  So does Eric Sheldon 1989.
  
  Wikipedia makes no mention of these points.

4. 
Scissors effect and time-of-light-variation-implies-size.
  See Rees 1966.
  There's the assertion in astrophysics that one can deduce the 
  size-order of an object from the time-scale of its light-variations, c*dt. 
  That's a statement that is quite true in the world of Newton. 
  But in SR, it can be off by the factor D (which always transforms periodic phenomena/time intervals as seen by a camera, according to speed/geometry).
  Scissors effect, when the object is relativistic and approaching the camera; this 
  speeds up the detection of time-variations (D), and overwhelms time dilation (Gamma).
  For example, beta = 0.87 has Gamma=2.03, and D=3.79 for the head-on case.
  For example, beta = 0.95 has Gamma=3.20, and D=6.24 for the head-on case.

5. 
Kraus et al 1999, 2000 
  Human eyes and spheres: doppler-and-beaming dominate the appearance.  
  The circular shape would not actually be visible to the human eye.

6. 
Photorealism: not just shape; spectrum and the response function of the human eye are important for both brightness and color.
  - angle/solid angle/outline (aberration)
  - brightness (beaming)
  - frequency (Doppler)
  - spectrum of the light coming in
  - response of the human eye to the light coming in (3 cones for color-bands; 1 rod for brightness)
  - representing the response of the human eye as RGB 
  It's tempting to ignore colors, since stars are dim; but bright stars have colors, and beaming 
  increases the brightness, so.... probably not the best idea, especially if the goal is photorealism!


7. The name of SR is poorly chosen!
https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1119/1.14437
https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1119/1.14631
https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1119/1.14354
It should have been called invariance theory.


6.
Dewan-Beran-Bell paradox with the string between accelerating objects.
John S. Bell, 1976
Interesting! The string breaks: in the comoving frame, the measured distance must be gamma times the 
distance measured in the lab frame (just regular Lorentz contraction).
It took me about 20 minutes to understand this.
Apparently Bell polled the staff at CERN, and most of them got this wrong!
https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.17728 
Controversy over whether or not the Fitzgerald contraction is a "real contraction" of the object!

7. 
Relativistic mass falls from favor.
Adler 1987



8.
Things I don't know about.
Light-cone coords (null coords).
Math: Quaternions for 4-vectors.
Math: Spinors in SR.
Math: Hyperbolic functions.

Does it already exist?

Tools?

Effort?

Survey -> Catalog
surveys are the massive primary data (pixel signals), catalogs are derived from the survey (physical params)

position, astrometric precision, time
surface brightness, angular res
photometry = low res spectroscopy
  wavelength
  F flux, maybe integrated over a bandpass; not the same as magnitude
  R resolution delta-lambda / lambda
  polarization, Stokes params
  F/DF inverse flux precision
  
Good coverage: vis, near IR, radio
Limited coverage: far IR, X-ray

dim dwarfs stronger in ir
ir has fewer dust problems
10-20 micron emission is mostly (?) dust
dust: https://www.astro.umd.edu/~richard/ASTRO421/Lecture_9.pdf
 - absorbs uv/vis/nir, emits thermal ir
 - emitted spectrum depends on the size distro of the particles! power law distro of sizes; eff-temp in emission 10-100K
 - size 1 molecule up to 0.5 microns
 - the spectrum seems to be more complex than for stars
 - the problem is that the size and composition of the matter is all over the place
 - seems to have a kink around 4 microns? a second bulge starts, 5-1000 microns?
 - 30-50% of starlight is absorbed by dust and re-radiated as far-IR!
 - it looks like I should perhaps stay only in the near-IR, to avoid the thermal re-emission; maybe I can get away with 
   still using black body spectra, by staying in the near-IR.
