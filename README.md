Explore the consequences of the Lorentz Transformations.

Mostly kinematics.

The book <em><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Classical_Mechanics'>Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</a></em> by Sussman, Wisdom, and Mayer
asserts that by implementing a physics theory in code, you gain deeper insight into the theory. 
I'm hoping that this is the case with this little project as well.

*"The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers."* - attributed to R. W. Hamming

In this project: 
 - c=1
 - the metric signature is (ct,x,y,z) = (+,-,-,-)

## Jargon

This project uses the following non-standard words (which you may find annoying):

**Grid** is used instead of *inertial frame of reference*.

**Elbow-boost** is used instead of *a non-collinear pair of boosts.*

**Corner-boost** is an elbow-boost with an angle of 90 degrees between boosts (as seen in the intermediate grid).

**Silberstein rotation** is used instead of *Thomas-Wigner rotation*.

**Flattening** is used instead of *Lorentz-Fitgerald contraction*.

**Time-slice** is used instead of *the intersection of an object's history with a space-like hypersurface of constant ct*.

**Light-slice** is used instead of *the intersection of an object's history with the past light cone of a detection-event*.

**Doppler cone** is used to refer to the cone generated by wave vectors *k<sup>i</sup>* having the same time component, but different directions.

## What I've learned so far in this project

**Working with units in which c=1 is natural and desirable.**
You can think, for example, of light-years and years, or light-seconds and seconds.
Numerically, its pleasant to work with numbers that are usually near 1.
It emphasizes the physics, and you aren't distracted by large or small numbers simply because of a choice of units.

**The speed β for some real objects (extreme cosmic rays) can't be represented with a Double in Java.**
It's too close to 1 (about 22 decimals). Only the *BigDecimal* class can represent such numbers.
However, working with *BigDecimal* is more painful than working with *Double*, so this is 
left out as a special case.

**Formulas: many-formulas versus one-formula is a very interesting question.**
This project implements as many calculations as possible with the core Lorentz Transformation, instead of using a new formula for each phenomenon. 
(The sole exception is the Thomas precession.) 

Advantages: 
 - it *directly* manifests how the Lorentz Transformation generates diverse phenomena.
 - it gives you more confidence in the *correctness* of your code, since each new use case acts as a test of the core formula.
 - it pushes one towards seeing the beautiful unity in the physics in as direct a manner as possible.

Having a new formula for each phenomenon is of course useful; but such formulas can be viewed as *short-cuts for human computation*. 
A computer program doesn't need such short-cuts. 
It actually benefits by avoiding them, since each new formula is a new source of potential error. 


**Formulas: textbooks and computer programs have opposing biases.**
Textbooks are biased towards the derivation of formulas for each phenomenon.
Computer programs are biased in the opposite direction, towards using as few formulas as possible.

**Computation is a teaching tool.**
It can be argued that computation provides an effective way of increasing one's understanding of physics, that could be used 
for one's first encounters with a theory.

 
**Various phenomena connected with the theory are all *aspects of one single thing*: the structure of space-time.**
(We can take the Lorentz Transformations as the definition of that structure.)

IS THIS CORRECT?
A beautiful example of this is the connection between aberration and the Doppler effect on the one hand (which are optical effects), and the flattening effect on the other hand (which is a geometrical effect).
To see the connection, look at the boost of a Doppler cone. 
(A Doppler cone is generated by a wave vector k<sup>i</sup> having a given frequency, but different spatial directions.)
In an unboosted grid K, the top of the Doppler cone forms a circle.
In a boosted grid K', that circle morphs into an ellipse.
The exact same morphing applies to events that correspond one-to-one to the wave vectors.
(The Lorentz Transformations are *agnostic*, in the sense that they apply to different sets of physical quantities.)
You can view the same circle and ellipse shapes as a time-slices across a history.
A corresponding boost from K' to K transforms the ellipse (a time-slice in K') into a circle (a time-slice in K).
That's just the flattening effect applied to an ellipse.

**The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigues%27_rotation_formula'>Rodrigues' rotation formula</a> is a useful and compact way of rotating a vector about an arbitrary axis.**


**Vector formulas usually have simpler implementations than component formulas.**
Moving from components to vectors can simplify a formula.
I found this with: 
 - the axis-angle approach to rotation (Rodrigues' formula)
 - the velocity transformation
 - the Lorentz transformation.

*However, I haven't retained this simplicity.*
What's more important to me here is to ensure correctness.
The main way of doing that is to have the core of almost all phenomena implemented by the Lorentz Transformations.
I have succeeded in doing so for all phenomena except for Thomas precession for circular motion. 
In that case, an implementation using the Lorentz Transformation requires numerical integration along the object's history.
(I have included an example which shows how using N boosts to approximate a circular orbit with regular-sided polygons 
closely approximates the formula for the Thomas precession.)


**Silberstein rotation is important.**
Most texts either ignore this effect altogether, or don't emphasize it.
This is unfortunate. 
This effect is one of the basic consequences of the Lorentz Transformations.


**Silberstein described the rotational aspect of elbow boosts <a href='https://archive.org/details/theoryofrelativi00silbrich/page/n7/mode/2up'>in 1914</a>.**
Thomas and Wigner came much later. 

**The geometry of an object (for example, the direction in which a stick is pointing) is in general affected by both regular flattening (Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction) and the Silberstein rotation.**
In general, when examining the geometry of an object, you need to disentangle these two effects.

**Characterizing the motion of a mass-particle in SR requires two additional items.**
When describing motion, everything comes from the position <b>r</b>(t).
In the Newtonian case, there are 3 main items describing the motion of a mass-particle:
  - <b>r</b>(t) position
  - <b>v</b>(t) velocity
  - <b>a</b>(t) acceleration
  
In SR, there are 5 main items characterizing the motion of a mass-particle:   
  - <b>r</b>(t) position
  - <b>v</b>(t) velocity
  - <b>a</b>(t) acceleration
  - a proper-time (because of time dilation)
  - an orientation (because of the Silberstein rotation)

Both proper-time and orientation are defined only as *differences* with respect to some chosen initial condition.  
  

**Transformations almost always come in two variants, characterized by the sign of some quantity.**
(For example, see this article on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_and_passive_transformation'>active and passive transformations</a>.) 
You need to always be aware of which case applies. 
It's very easy to forget this point, and to make mistakes in the sense of a transformation. 
It helps if the code makes this distinction hard to ignore.
(An example of a transformation that only has a single variant is the parity transformation: in order to reverse it, you apply the exact same operation a second time.)  

**Equations are poor at expressing the two-fold nature of transformations.**
Sometimes a transformation is written in a book in only one of its two possible forms, without stating its inverse.
This is misleading.

**Hollywood simulations of stars streaking rapidly by a relativistic spacecraft are definitely not realistic.** 
Most of the sky would appear black to the human eye.
Stars would almost always appear only in the forward direction. 
A rare exception would be a close fly-by of a bright early-type star (spectral class O, B), which would 
remain visible in the 'backward' direction for a long time.

**If you could accelerate at 1 gee for a year, you could cross the Milky Way in about a year of proper-time.**

**The prototype for a 4-vector isn't an event x, it's rather
<a href='http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Special_relativity:_mechanics'>the differential Δx</a>.**
This is because of the displacement-of-the-origin operation: it applies to events, but to nothing else:
it doesn't apply to differential 4-vectors, which aren't sensitive to the location of the origin.
I had forgotten this.
It's interesting how coding this led me to the same conclusion: applying a displacement-of-the-origin 
to a 4-velocity made no sense, and this became obvious in the computed result.
The displacement operation needs special handling, because it doesn't apply to differential 4-vectors (only to events).

**Four-vectors and three-vectors are not completely analogous**.
The cross product applies only to three-vectors.

The angle between vectors has a fundamentally different meaning in Minkowski space.
It's defined only between pairs of 4-vectors that are either both time-like or both space-like. 
Angles between 4-vectors are defined as ratios of lengths, but in this case these lengths come from the Minkowski metric, not the Euclidean one.
(Minkowski distance along a hyperbolic arc, divided by the 'radius' of the hyperbola, the distance from the origin to the apex of the hyperbola.)

**Light is simpler than matter.**
The physics of plane monochromatic waves is simpler than the physics of mass-particles.
Their speed is always the same. 
They don't have properties that apply only to mass-particles: acceleration, proper-time, and orientation (because of Silberstein rotation).
The effects of aberration and the Doppler effect are simpler to understand than the effects attached to matter (the distortions of geometry and time).
It can be argued that aberration and the Doppler effect should be investigated first when one explores the consequences of the Lorentz Transformation.
 

**Time dilation and length contraction are two sides of the same coin.**
The traveler measures flattening along the line of motion (and no time dilation on the spacecraft). 
The stay-at-home measures time dilation on the spacecraft (but no flattening-of-the-world along the line of its motion).


**The spatial geometry of an object is defined by a time-slice in the given grid (not a light-slice).**
Spatial geometry consists of two things: distances and angles.
To measure the length of a stick (in a given grid), you need a time-slice, a surface with <em>ct=constant</em>, (in that grid).
To measure the direction in which a stick is pointing (in a given grid), you also need a time-slice (in that grid).

**Change-of-angles is just as significant as change-of-dimensions. The term *length contraction* is a misleading one.**
The effect changes more than length: it changes geometry, angles, length, shape.
A better word is *flattening*.
Length contraction emphasizes a special case: when a stick is parallel to the line of the boost.
Only that special case has geometrical changes characterized solely as a change of length.
In every other case, the stick will change both length and direction.


**A history intersects in dramatically different ways with a time-slice versus a light-slice.**
The intersection of a time-slice surface (with <em>ct=constant</em>) with an object's history defines the spatial geometry of an object, relative to a grid.
The intersection of the past light cone of a detector with an object's history defines the optical appearance of the object at the detector.

For a receding stick travelling parallel to its longest dimension, the light-slice is always shorter than the time-slice when it's receding from the detector.
At ultra-relativistic recession speeds, the light-slice length approaches 0.5 times the time-slice length.

For an approaching stick, the light-slice length is always longer than the time-slice length.
Indeed, the light-slice shows an expansion over the rest-length.
 
**Matrix forms are useful.**
With rearrangement of the covariant/contravariant indices, some standard expressions based on index gymnastics can be 
brought into a form which maps exactly to matrix multiplication. Example: the transformation of the electromagnetic field tensor.

**Aberration and the Doppler effect are two aspects of one phenomenon.**
Both come directly from the Lorentz Transformation of the wave vector k<sup>i</sup>.

**Two boosts commute only when they are in the same line.**
An elbow-boost (two non-collinear boosts) is equivalent to a boost plus a rotation.
The rotation is absent if the two boosts are along the same axis.
The Silberstein (Thomas-Wigner) rotation angle is small for low speeds, but for 
ultra-relativistic speeds it increases rapidly without bound.

What's the relation between the Silberstein rotation and the regular geometry distortion of a boost?
A stick is angled at θ with respect to the direction of a boost.
After the boost, both the stick's length and orientation are different.
The formula relating the direction of the stick in the two grids is:
```
cot θ = (1/Γ) cot θ' 
```
The *change* in this angle θ is precisely the same as the Silberstein rotation angle:
```
tan θ = -(Γ1*Γ2*β1*β2)/(Γ1 + Γ2)
```
This confuses me. It seems like the breakdown of two boosts = boost + rotation no longer needs the rotation.

**Terrell's paper *Invisibility of the Lorentz Contraction* (1959) seems to be of low quality.**
He simply asserts that the geometry is that of a rotation. He seems to be incorrect.
Here are some <a href='https://github.com/johanley/special-relativity-core/blob/master/notes/references.txt'>references</a> that contradict Terrell's assertions.

Scott and van Driel (1970):
  'The relation of the distortion to Terrel's (sic) "apparent rotation" can be appreciated but 
  certainly an interpretation merely in terms of rotation is not possible. The Lorentz contraction 
  can indeed be photographed but shows properly only in a direction perpendicular to the motion.'
  (van Driel and Scott have diagrams that are not for Terrell's case of small solid angle).
  
Mathews and Lakshmanan (1972): 
  "... the apparent shape is related to the shape at rest through a combination of nonuniform shear and 
  extension/contraction parallel to the direction of motion, which does not reduce to a rotation even 
  in the case of distant objects subtending a small angle at the observer... Clearly this picture of apparent rotation 
  cannot be right. "
  
See also Scott and Viner (1965), Eric Sheldon (1989).
  
The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotation'>wikipedia article</a> makes no mention of these points.
