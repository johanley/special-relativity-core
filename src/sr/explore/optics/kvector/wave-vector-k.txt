A boost parallel to the wave-vector k changes the frequency only.
  Boost [0.6,0.0,0.0]
  Input k in frame K [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0] mag 0.0
  Output k in frame K'[0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0] mag 0.0

A boost anti-parallel to the wave-vector k changes the frequency only.
  Boost [-0.6,0.0,0.0]
  Input k in frame K [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0] mag 0.0
  Output k in frame K'[2.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0] mag 0.0

A random boost not parallel to the wave-vector k changes both the frequency and the direction.
  Boost [0.6,0.0,0.0]
  Input k in frame K [1.0, 0.26726, 0.53452, 0.80178] mag 0.0
  Output k in frame K'[1.04955, -0.41592, 0.53452, 0.80178] mag 0.0
