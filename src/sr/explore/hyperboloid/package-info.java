/** 
 Four-velocity space is a hyperbolic space with constant negative curvature.
 
 <P>The squared-magnitude of the four-velocity is fixed at +1.
 This means that the "tip" of the four-velocity is confined to the unit hyperboloid, and more specifically to 
 its future-directed branch.
 
 <P>A branch of the unit hyperboloid is a chart of what mathematicians call the <em>hyperbolic plane</em>.
 In this case, its curvature is -1 (<em>-c</em>).
  
 <P>It's interesting to note that curved geometry does have a non-trivial role to place in special relativity, 
  even though space-time itself is flat.
