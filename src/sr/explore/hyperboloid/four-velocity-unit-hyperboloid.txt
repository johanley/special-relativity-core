Elbow-boost from K to K' to K''.
Take the point of view of K'.
There are three 4-velocities to consider in the frame K':
  [1.1547, -0.57735, 0.0, 0.0] negative of the boost from K to K'.
  [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] at rest in K'.
  [1.1547, 0.40825, 0.40825, 0.0] the boost from K' to K''.

** This triplet of 4-velocities make a triangle on the unit hyperboloid. **
This is because the squared-magnitude of any 4-velocity is always +1 (when c=1).
Values for the sides of the triangle correspond to the (integrated) space-time interval along an arc on the hyperboloid.
The unit hyperboloid inherits its metric from the space-time pseudo-metric.

This becomes a simple problem in hyperbolic geometry.
You solve it using hyperbolic analogues of the cosine-law and the sine-law from Euclidean geometry.

Here's the result, showing the full data for the triangle (with sides 'ABC', and angles 'abc'):

ABC[0.54931,1.02177,0.54931] abc[0.34442,2.35619,0.34442] angular-defect:0.09656

The triangle yields two results of interest:
  - the addition of two non-co-linear velocities
  - the corresponding kinematic (Wigner) rotation (whose size is the angular-defect of the triangle)

The velocity of K'' with respect to K is computed using the triangle's data:
  Speed comes from tanh(B): 0.77059
  Direction with respect to the +X-axis is the angle 'a': 0.34442
  Hence the velocity of K'' with respect to K is: 
    Velocity: [0.72533,0.26019,0.0]
    Four-velocity: [1.56904, 1.13807, 0.40825, 0.0]

The magnitude of the corresponding kinematic (Wigner) rotation equals the angular-defect of the triangle: 0.09656

Now use other techniques to calculate the same things, and compare the results.

For velocity addition, the alternate calculation gives:
  Velocity: [0.72533,0.26019,0.0]
  Four-velocity: [1.56904, 1.13807, 0.40825, 0.0]

For the corresponding kinematic (Wigner) rotation, the alternate calculation gives:
  Î¸w: 0.09656

These agree with the above results.
