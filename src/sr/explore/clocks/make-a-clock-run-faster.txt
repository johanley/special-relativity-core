A clock's rate relative to a grid can also DECREASE because of a boost.
This happens simply because a boost can decrease the relative speed of the clock.

Clock approaching with β: 0.9
Clock rate relative to the grid: 0.43589

If a boost of 0.4 is AWAY FROM the approaching clock,
then the relative speed decreases, and the rate of the clock increases.

Clock approaching with β: 0.5
Clock rate relative to the grid: 0.866025
