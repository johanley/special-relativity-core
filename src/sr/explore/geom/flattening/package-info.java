/**
 The flattening effect (Lorentz-Fitzgerald length contraction).
 
 The term <em>length contraction</em> is misleading.
 The flattening changes geometry: length <em>and</em> angles.
 To limit the term to length seems misleading. 
 It places too much emphasis on a special case: when a stick is parallel to the line of a boost.
 When a stick is at an angle to the line of the boost, then the stick both 
 contracts and changes direction, as measured in the boosted grid.
