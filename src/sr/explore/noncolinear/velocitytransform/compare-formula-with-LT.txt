Compare results from the velocity transformation formula with results directly from the Lorentz transformation.

With no loss of generality, in K we have:
 - a object velocity v in K in any old direction
 - a frame K' boosted with respect to K along the +X-axis.
So the task is to find v_K', the velocity with respect to the boosted frame K'.

Using the velocity transformation formula we get:
Boost: [0.8,0.0,0.0] Velocity v_K:[0.1,0.2,0.3]
v_K' from formula:[-0.76087,0.13043,0.19565] mag:0.79638

Using the Lorentz transformation directly we get:
v_K by approximating the derivative, using a history in K: [0.1,0.2,0.3] mag: 0.37417
v_K' by approximating the derivative, using a history in K and its boost-transform: [-0.76087,0.13043,0.19565] mag: 0.79638
