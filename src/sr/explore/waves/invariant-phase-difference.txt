Examine the dot product k.x, the phase of a plane wave of a single frequency.
 - k is the phase-gradient four-vector.
 - x is an event.
 - K, K' are inertial frames.


Use the phase-gradient k for light waves in a vacuum.

K: event x:[10.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
K: k:[1.0, 0.57735, 0.57735, 0.57735]
K: dot-product k.x: 4.80385

Transform: boost [0.55,0.0,0.0]
K': dot-product k'.x': 4.80385

Transform: rotation[1.0,2.0,3.0]
K': dot-product k'.x': 4.80385

Transform: displacement[0.0, 85.0, 0.0, 0.0]
K': dot-product k'.x': 53.87862

For displacement operations, you need to examine DIFFERENCES in k.x for two different events:
K: event a:[10.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
K: event b:[11.0, 5.0, 22.0, 7.0]
K: k:[1.0, 0.57735, 0.57735, 0.57735]
K: difference in the dot-product (k.b - k.a) = k.(b-a): -13.43376
Transform: displacement[0.0, 85.0, 0.0, 0.0]
K': difference in the dot-product (k'.b' - k'.a') = k'.(b'-a'): -13.43376

Remember that the true 4-vector is Î”x, not x.
