Stick is stationary in K''. Points along the +X''-axis. Has ends at X=1 and X=2.
Rest length of the stick in K'': 1.0
Corner-boost backwards from K'' to K: boost [0.0,-0.6,0.0] boost [-0.8,0.0,0.0]

All of the items below are in K.

Time-slice across the stick's history in K.
Examine two events, one for each end of the stick.
Event for A: [3.20833, 3.16667, 0.675, 0.0] one end of the stick.
Event for B: [3.20833, 3.76667, 0.195, 0.0] other end of the stick.
Difference (B - A): [0.0, 0.6, -0.48, 0.0] has ct=0 (time-slice).
Angle of the stick with respect to the X-axis: -38.66°
Length of the stick: 0.768. It shows some contraction.
 
Disentangle two effects: Silberstein rotation versus flattening.

FIRST DO A ROTATION (because of the Silberstein rotation).
Examine the equivalent-boost with respect to K (the boost+rotation pair that's equivalent to the corner-boost pair):
  equivβ: 0.877
  equivDirection: 24.228° with respect to the X-axis.
  equivθw: -18.925° rotation around the Z-axis (which thus affects the XY plane).
  (equivθw - equivDirection): -43.152° with respect to the equivDirection.

SECOND DO A FLATTENING (because of the equivalent-boost).
Use a formula for flattening(equivθw - equivDirection, equivβ): -62.888° with respect to the equivDirection.
 
The same result comes from examining the raw history of the stick.
Angle of the stick with respect to the equivDirection (not the X-axis) from raw histories: -62.888° - SAME AS ABOVE
