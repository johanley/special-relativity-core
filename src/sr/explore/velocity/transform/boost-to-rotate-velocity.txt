Find a boost that will rotate a velocity vector by 20.0°.

boost_v_K [0.6,0.0,0.0] size 0.6
boost_v_rotated_K [0.56382,0.20521,0.0] size 0.6
The desired boost needed in K' is v_Kp [-0.05468,0.2481,0.0] size 0.254054

As a check, re-do the calculation using the formula that takes v_Kp as a parameter.
v_K (same as boost_v_rotated) [0.56382,0.20521,0.0] size 0.6
