For circular motion, the kinematic rotation is simply cumulative, and adds up over time.
Calculate kinematic rotation in the case of the (low-speed) Earth orbiting the barycenter of the solar system, over a long time scale.
Assume a circular orbit.

Average speed of the Earth with respect to the barycenter of the solar system:
 107208.0 km/h
 29.78 km/s
 29780.0 m/s
 9.933538755000969E-5 light-years/year (Î²)

Rotation after one revolution: 3.099972597283817E-8 rads (about 6.4 milliarcseconds per year)
Revolutions (years) needed for a cumulative rotation of 1 arc minute: 9383.6 years.
Revolutions (years) needed for a cumulative rotation of 1 degree: 563014.4 years.

For kinematic rotation to affect the Earth's orientation by 1 degree, it takes about 600,000 years.
This calculation isn't physically meaningless.
The effect is simply 'added to' whatever happens to affect the Earth's orientation.
