/** 
 A standard 3-vector, with three spatial components, with no constraints on the component values.
 
  <P>Using an interface was found to be necessary. 
  Different vectors have different requirements.
  For example, the velocity components need to be in the range (-1,1).
  
  <P>Note the following differences with 4-vectors:
  <ul>
   <li>there's no cross product for 4-vectors.
   <li>the 'square' of a 4-vector can be of either sign.
   <li>the idea of time-like, space-like, and light-like vectors. 
   <li>the angle between four-vectors needs reinterpretation: the angle is not a Euclidean angle, but a hyperbolic angle 
   (arc lengths via Minkowski metric), and you it's defined only if the two four-vectors are both time-like or both space-like.
  </ul>
