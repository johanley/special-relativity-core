/** 
 Transform the space-time coords of an event from one inertial frame K to another frame K'.
 
 <P>The operations can also be viewed not as a change of inertial frame, 
 but as mapping of one 4-vector to another, all with respect to the same inertial frame.
 
 <P>Transformation operations can be chained together in a pipeline. 
 A pipeline can also be reversed, to compute the inverse transformation from K' to K.
