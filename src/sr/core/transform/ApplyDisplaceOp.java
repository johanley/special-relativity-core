 This enum exists because {@link Displace} operations don't apply to all 4-vectors.
 The prototype 4-vector is actually not an event vector x, but rather  
 its displacement Î”x, which is unaffected by changes in the origin.
 
 <P>A {@link Displace} operation leaves differential 4-vectors unchanged, but 
 will indeed alter the 4-vector representing an event.
 
 <P>General code which applies {@link CoordTransform}s to {@link FourVectors} needs 
 to know when to apply {@link Displace} operations.
