 History for a particle with mass moving uniformly from infinity to the frame's origin, then in the opposite direction back out to infinity.
 
 <P>The two legs take place at the same speed.
 The origin event is the turnaround event.

            |  * 
 </pre>

 
  <P>The parameter for the history is the coordinate-time <em>ct</em>.
 Negative <em>ct</em> means before the turnaround, and positive <em>ct</em> is after the turnaround.
