/**
 A triangle in hyperbolic geometry, as represented as a triangle on a unit hyperboloid.
 
 <P>Hyperbolic geometries have a constant negative curvature.
 (Here that curvature is -1, because we take <em>c = 1</em>.)
 
 <P>The geometry on the unit hyperboloid is conformal: angles have the usual meaning as in Euclidean geometry.
 
 <P>The three sides of the triangle are named <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>C</em>, 
 and the three angles are named <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>.
 Angle <em>a</em> is opposite the side <em>A</em>, and so on.
 
 <P>In special relativity, the unit hyperboloid arises naturally because four-velocity is a unit vector (when <em>c = 1</em>). 
 This means that the four-velocity is "confined" to the future-branch of the unit hyperboloid in four-velocity space.
 This space-like surface is sometimes called <em>H<sup>+</sup></em>.
 
 <P><b>This class models triangles on <em>H<sup>+</sup></em></b>.
 
 <P>Here, the number attached to a side of such a triangle equates to the total space-time interval 
 integrated along a space-like arc on <em>H<sup>+</sup></em>.
 With our convention for <em>(ct,x,y,z)</em> as <em>(+---)</em>, it's necessary to take the negative of the quadratic form, 
 <em>- (Î”s)<sup>2</sup></em>, in order to get a non-negative value.  
 With this change, <em>H<sup>+</sup></em> has a truly Riemannian geometry, where the metric is indeed greater than or equal to 0.
 
 <P>The arc-interval is simple to calculate, given two four-velocities <em>u1</em> and <em>u1</em> representing the endpoints of the arc: 
 <pre>arccosh(u1.dot(u2))</pre>

 <P>In special relativity, space-time itself is flat.
 But for four-velocity, it's very interesting that a curved Riemannian geometry has a central role to play.
